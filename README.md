##Description
This pricing panel exercise is a great way to practice using CSS flexbox and media queries to create a responsive design. The exercise requires you to recreate a pricing panel that includes multiple pricing tiers and features.

I used HTML and CSS, with a focus on using flexbox and media queries to create a responsive and visually appealing design. The final result closely matches the original design, and I learned a lot about CSS layout in the process.
